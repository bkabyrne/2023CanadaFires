## Overview:

This repository contains python programs used to 1. Process TROPOMI CO retrievals (./TROPOMI_superobs), 2. generate the input data for the CO inversions (./CO_inversions/Prepare_inversion), 3. process the output from the CO inversions (CO_inversions/Process_output), and 4. make figures shown in the paper (plot_figures). Climate data were downloaded as described in the methods sections. Inverse estimates can be reproduced using the GEOS-Chem adjoint, which can be downloaded from here: http://wiki.seas.harvard.edu/geos-chem/index.php/Quick_Start_Guide, following the inversion set-up described in the methods. All of the results of the manuscript can be reproduced from the data provided (provided separately upon manuscript publication). The python codes can reproduce the figures from the manuscript from those data.

## Required content:

1. System Requirements

This code has been tested on the NASA Pleiades computing system (UNIX). The python routined were run using python3/3.9.12

2. Installation guide

No instillation is required. This code should run on any system with python3/3.9.12 and loaded modules

3. Demo

Python routines in main directory can be run to re-create all of the figures in the paper. All of the python codes should run in under 10 minutes.

4. Instructions for use

Execute each python routine and the Figures shown in the manuscript and supplement will be written to the Figures sub-directory. The header of each python code describes the figures made by that particular code.
